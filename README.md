 I have created windows application for Superstore inventory management.
 User will be able to add items to inventory.
 User can search for item in inventory.
 User will be able to update the price and stock quantity.
 Thereâ€™s goanna be another page for creating invoice which will check if entered quantity by user is less than or equal to that in the inventory and then generate the invoice for it.
